MapD has changed our name to OmniSci. This new name reflects our new mission statement: to make analytics instant, powerful and effortless for everyone.

From our founder, Todd Mostak [@tmostak](https://github.com/tmostak):

“Our original name comes from ‘massively parallel database’ (MapD for short). But throughout these first five years our vision has evolved and significantly broadened. We have built a platform that has expanded well beyond being just a database. We realized that we needed a new name that could better carry us forward for the next stage of our journey as a company.”
